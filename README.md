# Derek Long

Hello, world!

I'm Derek, a senior student at BYU-I, studying Computer Information Technology.

## About

As it turns out, "Computer Information Technology" means many different things: full-stack web development, database management, network design, systems security, operating systems administration, and so on.
Personal experience aside from that includes 3d modeling and texture editing, bash and other scripting, lots of messing around with vector graphics.

Some things I'd like to learn are some of the deeper languages: C, C++, maybe Rust, and so on. I've been using Linux on my PCs for over ten years now, and it would be very useful to be able to eg. write my own drivers instead of having to wait on others to get around to it.

I actually got my start on Axe, a C-like programming language for the 83/84 series of z80 graphing calculators that compiled directly on the device itself. Looking to get back to something a little bit more gritty like that.

## Techs and Tools

- Inkscape
- GIMP
- Blender
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (only vanilla for now)
- Backend: SQL, PHP, Linux console
- Linux desktop in general
